## Instructions

Welcome to the Memory Game project!  To get started, clone the GitHub repository to your local machine and open the index.html file to begin the game.

The object of the game is to find matching cards by clicking them.  A user wins once all cards have successfully been matched.

When a user wins the game, a modal appears to congratulate the player and ask if they want to play again. It should also tell the user how much time it took to win the game, and what the star rating was.

A restart button allows the player to reset the game board, the timer, and the star rating.

## Star Rating

The game displays a star rating (from 1-3) that reflects the player's performance. At the beginning of a game, it should display 3 stars.

* After 14  moves, the star rating will change to 2
* After 20  moves, the star rating will change to 1

## Timer

When the player starts a game, a timer should also start. Once the player wins the game, the timer stops.

## Move Counter

Game displays the current number of moves a user has made.
